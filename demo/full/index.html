<!--
I'm going to walk you throught the entire application and explain
how it is set up and works. This way you will better appreciate the benefits
of the framework

Mainly, I am going to talk about ngModular, but we'll touch on some other
useful modules of adhesive.js.

Nothing crazy here, just regular html, however, note there's no ng-app
directive, we are not doing auto-bootstrap.

  Build number is very important thing here. It's used for cache buster
  to make sure all files are up to date on every load during the development
  and on every release in production.

  In production you would use a static string, i.e. version or an actual
  build number, so it would look something like:
  <script>var BUILD_NUMBER = '1.0.1';</script>
  -->
  <script>var BUILD_NUMBER = new Date();
  BUILD_NUMBER = BUILD_NUMBER.getTime();</script>

  <h4>Full-scale demo and tutorial</h4>

  <p>This sample application is built based on <b>ngModular</b>, which automatically resolves
    paths and downloads application modules on demand, as you walk through
    the app. See it in action by watching the <b>Network tab</b>
    in the developer console.</p>

  <p>Discover the <b>tutorial materials</b> in the source code comments.
    Start with index.html and it will guide you through.</p>

  <h3>Menu</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#/">Home</a> - modue/index, go back to the home page.</li>
    <li><a href="#/example">Example</a> - module/example, originally not pre-loaded, demonstrates <b>dynamic
      routing</b> and on demand auto-loading.
    </li>
    <li><a href="#/test">Example (#/test)</a> - module/example, demonstrates alias routing, uses custom resolution
      for <b>auto-loader</b>.
    </li>
    <li><a href="#/blog">Blog</a> - module/blog, demonstrates permissions handled by ngAuth module.</li>
    <li><a href="#/non-existing-module">Non-existing module</a> - there's no module to serve this route,
      demonstrates
      handling of a case when module was not found.
    </li>
    <li data-ng-show="!auth.loggedIn">
      <a href="#/login">Log in</a> - <b>ngAuth</b>, use any random credentials to log in, if login and password matches
      authentication will be denied.<br>
      Usernames that start with <b>super</b> and <b>admin</b> have special permissions.
    </li>
    <li data-ng-show="auth.loggedIn">
      <a href="#/logout">Log out</a> |

We load require.js and point it to the app/init.js script to initialize the app.
Note, this is the only script we load here, everything else is handled
by the require.
Proceed to the app/init.js
