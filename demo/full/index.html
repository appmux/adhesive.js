I'm going to walk you throught the entire application and explain
how it is set up and works. This way you will better appreciate the benefits
of the framework

Mainly, I am going to talk about ngModular, but we'll touch on some other
useful modules of adhesive.js.

Nothing crazy here, just regular html, however, note there's no ng-app
directive, we are not doing auto-bootstrap.

  Build number is very important thing here. It's used for cache buster
  to make sure all files are up to date on every load during the development
  and on every release in production.
  
  In production you would use a static string, i.e. version or an actual
  build number, so it would look something like:
  <script>var BUILD_NUMBER = '1.0.1';</script>
  -->
  <script>var BUILD_NUMBER = new Date(); BUILD_NUMBER = BUILD_NUMBER.getTime();</script>

    <p>This sample application is built based on ngModular, which automatically resolves
    paths and downloads application modules on demand, as you walk through
    the app. See it in action by watching the Network tab
    in the developer console.</p>
    
    <h3>Example links</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#/">Index module</a> - go back to the index view.</li>
      <li><a href="#/example">Load Example module</a> - demonstrates dynamic
      routing, on demand auto-loading.</li>
      <li><a href="#/test">Example (#/test)</a> - alias route, uses custom resolution
      for auto-loader.</li>
      <li><a href="#/non-existing-module">Non-existing module</a> - handle
      an event when module was not found.</li>
